<p>The demand for an International Database for Barley Genes and Barley
    Genetic Stocks began already in the 1980s. Compiling data started in
    1971 in Barley Genetics Newsletters first issue, but took an
    intensely new turn during the 1990s.</p>
<p>This constructed database you
    find here comprises two parts. The main part shows an overall
    structure of the descriptions with special paragraphs dedicated to
    cover previous nomenclature, inheritance, locus location,
    descriptions of morphological and physiological characters, the first
    detected mutant, mutant events, mutants used for description, parent
    germplasm and references. It includes for the locus name the use of
    the three-letter symbols. The chromosome numbers and arms
    designations are based on the Triticeae system. Both systems were
    approved at the business meeting of the Seventh International Barley
    Genetics Symposium on 5th August 1996. Each mutant is associated with
    a stock number, this barley genetic stock (BGS) number corresponds to
    an accession (GSHO or NGB) number kept in the Barley Genetic Stock
    Collection, Aberdeen, Idaho, USA, or at NordGen, Alnarp, Sweden. Only one
    allele of each description is kept at the Main Stock Center in Aberdeen but all
alleles are stored at NordGen.</p>
<p>During many years hundreds of genetic
  stocks containing morphological and physiological characters were
  brought together world-wide from different regions and different
  backgrounds. By the tremendous and skillful
  crossing work of  J.D. Franckowiak, USA, it was possible to transfer about 1000 of these genes
  into a common genetic background, the two-rowed cultivar &lsquo;Bowman&rsquo;.
  These lines are also included in this database. The BGS database now
  comprises about 700 hundred descriptions with more than 4000 alleles
  and about 2000 references. Many of the genes are illustrated with
  images, both overviews and close-up character photographs. Most of
  them are taken in Bowman backcrossed derived lines and compared with
the normal cultivar.</p>
<p>The second part of the database comprises basic information of about all
  10000 Swedish barley mutants to find their original stock accession
  for degeneration, mutagens used for induction, inheritance and their
  relation to BGS descriptions. The database is easy to be used, by names, symbols and other objects you
  are looking for. (Many of the germplasm accessions are hyperlinked to
  Web pages of the holding gene banks in order to facilitate easy
  ordering of material.)</p>
